Phase 4.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

...........................
WARNING:Place:1019 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB /
   clock site pair. The clock component <BUTTON_SOUTH_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y0>. The IO component
   <BUTTON_SOUTH> is placed at site <IPAD199>.  This will not allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the
   Clock buffer. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <BUTTON_SOUTH.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is
   recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
